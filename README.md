This repository contains a [nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) community build of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) serocomplex viruses that is accessible [here](https://nextstrain.org/groups/ViennaRNA/VEEnext). Alternatively, you can drag & drop the [VEE.json](auspice/VEE.json) file directly at [auspice.us](https://auspice.us).

Data in this community build rely on publicly available VEE genomes from NCBI Genbank. New releases are published on an irregular basis when a reasonable amount of novel sequences are available.

Automated lineage designations were performed by using [AUTOLIN](https://jmcbroome-automated-lineage-json-streamlit-app-3adskh.streamlit.app/) under default settings.
